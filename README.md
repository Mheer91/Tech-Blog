## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with creating an intuitive tech blog from the ground up. This was a great assignment to really reinforce the MVC structure as well as diving deeper into express.js routing and sequelize. 

## Technology Used 
For this project I added a package I found during our second project that has 130 pre-made handlebars helpers. The package is called handlebars-helpers and can be found here: https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers

### NPM Packages:
- bcrypt
- connect-session-sequelize
- dotenv
- express
- express-handlebars
- express-session
- handlebars
- handlebars-helpers
- mysql2
- sequelize
